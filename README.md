The 'Molecular information.xlsx' file contains the molecular structures and six photophysical properties of about 563 AIE molecules collected from the literature over the years.
The file includes SMILES, maximum absorption wavelengths (λabs), maximum emission wavelengths in monomeric and aggregated states (λem_mono, λem_agg), quantum yields in monomeric and aggregated states (Φmono, Φagg), and their difference (Φagg-Φmono).
